The script [getflag.sh](getflag.sh) is a simple way to access a website and retrieve the flag text shown on the webpage using the commands `curl`, `grep` and `echo`.

To use the script, you need to provide the IP address of the machine as an argument when running the script. For example:

`./script.sh 10.10.63.99`

This will retrieve the webpage at `http://10.10.63.99` and print the flag text if it's found.

**Note:** this script is just an automated solution, you're also able to find the flag by simply opening the website in a browser and searching for it.
