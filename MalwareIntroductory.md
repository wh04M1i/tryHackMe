## Understanding Malware Campaigns

* Types of malware attacks:

  * Targeted - for specific purpose, against specific target

  * Mass campaign - purpose is to infect as many devices as possible; also known as APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)

```markdown
1. What is the famous example of a targeted attack-esque Malware that targeted Iran? - Stuxnet

2. What is the name of the Ransomware that used the Eternalblue exploit in a "Mass Campaign" attack? - Wannacry
```

## Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened

* Processes of a malware attack:

  * Delivery

  * Execution

  * Maintaining persistence

  * Propagation

* Two categories of fingerprints left behind by malware:

  * Host-based signatures

  * Network-based signatures

```markdown
1. Name the first essential step of a Malware Attack? - Delivery

2. Name the second essential step of a Malware Attack? - Execution

3. What type of signature is used to classify remnants of infection on a host? - Host-based signatures

4. What is the name of the other classification of signature used after a Malware attack? - Network-based signatures
```

* Categories of analysing malware:

  * Static analysis - to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample.

  * Dynamic analysis - involves executing the sample and observing what happens.

## Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files

```markdown
1. The MD5 Checksum of aws.exe - D2778164EF643BA8F44CC202EC7EF157

2. The MD5 Checksum of Netlogo.exe - 59CB421172A89E1E16C11A428326952C

3. The MD5 Checksum of vlc.exe - 5416BE1B8B04B1681CB39CF0E2CAAD9F

4. Does Virustotal report this MD5 Checksum / file aws.exe as malicious? - Nay

5. Does Virustotal report this MD5 Checksum / file Netlogo.exe as malicious? - Nay

6. Does Virustotal report this MD5 Checksum / file vlc.exe as malicious? - Nay
```

## Identifying if the Executables are obfuscated / packed

* The compiler/packer of the file can be found with the ```PEiD``` tool.

```markdown
1.  What does PeID propose 1DE9176AD682FF.dll being packed with? - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 DLL

2. What does PeID propose AD29AA1B.bin being packed with? - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
```

## What is Obfuscation / Packing?

* Packing is a form of obfuscation that malware authors employ to prevent the analysis of programs.

* Obfuscated code is much harder to analyze at the static level.

```markdown
1. What packer does PeID report file "6F431F46547DB2628" to be packed with? - FSG 1.0 -> dulek/xt
```

## Introduction to Strings

* Strings are the ASCII/text contents of a program.

* ```PE Explorer``` tool can be used as a GUI application for Strings.

```markdown
1. What is the URL that is outputted after using "strings" - practicalmalwareanalysis.com

2. How many unique "Imports" are there? - 5
```

## Introduction to Imports

* Disassemblers reverse the compile code of a program from machine code to human-readable instructions (assembly).

* Debuggers use the same technique as disassemblers, and facilitate execution of the program, to view the changes through each step of the program.

* We can use ```IDA Freeware``` as a tool for both static and dynamic analysis.

```markdown
1. How many references are there to the library "msi" in the "Imports" tab of IDA Freeware for "install.exe" - 9
```

## Practical Summary

```markdown
1. What is the MD5 Checksum of the file? - F5BD8E6DC6782ED4DFA62B8215BDC429

2. Does Virustotal report this file as malicious? - Yay

3. What is the last string outputted? - d:h:

4. What is the output of PeID when trying to detect what packer is used by the file? - Nothing found *
```
