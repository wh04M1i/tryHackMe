* For [reverse-searching videos](https://nixintel.info/osint-tools/using-ffmpeg-to-grab-stills-and-audio-for-osint/), we can use tools such as [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to extract key images and audio, and then reverse-search.

```shell
which ffmpeg
#shows path for ffmpeg

ffmpeg -i task9.mp4 -r 1 img%06d.jpg -hide_banner
#to grab all frames from the video
#-r 1 is for capturing only one frame from one second of video
#img%6d.jpg is for naming protocol of images
#gives us 49 images

ffmpeg -i task9.mp4 -vn taskaudio.mp3
#this extracts the sound from the video
#optional
```

```markdown
From the extracted images, we can reverse-search key images.

Using the multiple clues, we can find out the location.
